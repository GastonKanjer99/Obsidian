#### Mysterious Origin.
Nobody really knows the true nature of the false hydra. Scholars the world over are left guessing as to the true nature of these creatures. What is known is that by the time their presence is apparent, it is often too late. The false hydra begins its life cycle as a lump of white flesh, growing and festering deep beneath the ground of a town or city. Their genesis is brought on by an abundance of lies and half-truths told by members of a community. Often these creatures manifest in kingdoms where propaganda has become out of control. Eventually, the small fleshy mass, no larger than a fist, grows to the size of a small child and sprouts a single head on a prehensile neck. This is when the false hydra truly begins its cycle. It burrows up through the ground until it reaches the surface, or a chamber with easy access to the surface of the ground such as a sewer, cave, or castle basement. Once it emerges, the false hydra begins to sing a deep and guttural dirge that can be faintly heard for miles around. This song makes all who hear it unable to perceive the false hydra. This is not invisibility, but something much more insidious. The false hydra removes itself from the mind of every sentient creature that can hear its song, meaning it can still be seen, but it is immediately forgotten by those who see it even as they stare directly at its moony face.
