### Attack

The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.  
With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “[Making an Attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_31)” section for the rules that govern attacks.  
  
Certain features, such as the [Extra Attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Character%20Advancement#toc_11) feature of the [fighter](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Fighter?expansion=34047#content), allow you to make more than one attack with this action.  
  

### Cast a Spell

Spellcasters such as [wizards](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Wizard?expansion=34047#content) and [clerics](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Cleric?expansion=34047#content), as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a [casting time](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#toc_11), which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a [reaction](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_8), minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. [Casting a spell](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#toc_10) is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.  
  

### Dash

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra [movement](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Movement?expansion=34047#content) for the current turn. The increase equals your [speed](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Movement?expansion=34047#toc_1), after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.  
Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.  
  

### Disengage

If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke [opportunity attacks](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_40) for the rest of the turn.  
  

### Dodge

When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding [attacks](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_21). Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has [disadvantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_2) if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are [incapacitated](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=34047#toc_6) (as explained in [Conditions](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=34047#content) ) or if your speed drops to 0.  
  

### Help

You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains [advantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_2) on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.  
  
Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with [advantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_2).  
  

### Hide

When you take the Hide action, you make a [Dexterity (Stealth) check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_18) in an attempt to hide, following the rules for [hiding](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_22). If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “[Unseen Attackers and Targets](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_35)” section.  
  

### Ready

Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your [reaction](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_8) before the start of your next turn.  
First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to [move](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_9) up to your speed in response to it. Examples include “If the [cultist](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Cultist?expansion=34047#content) steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the [goblin](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Goblin?expansion=34047#content) steps next to me, I move away.”  
  
When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.  
  
When you ready a [spell](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#toc_2), you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a [casting time](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#toc_11) of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic requires [concentration](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#toc_22). If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the _[web](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Web?expansion=34047#content)_ spell and ready _[magic missile](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Magic%20Missile?expansion=34047#content)_, your _web_ spell ends, and if you take damage before you release _magic missile_ with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.  
  

### Search

When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a [Wisdom (Perception) check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_30) or an [Intelligence (Investigation) check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_27).  
  

### Use an Object

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.  
  

## Making an Attack

Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a [spell](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#toc_2), an attack has a simple structure.  
  

1. **Choose a target**. Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2. **Determine modifiers**. The GM determines whether the target has [cover](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_45) and whether you have [advantage or disadvantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_2) against the target. In addition, [spells](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#toc_2), special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3. **Resolve the attack**. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

If there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.  
  

### Attack Rolls

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.  
  

#### Modifiers to the Roll

When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an [ability modifier](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_1) and the character’s [proficiency bonus](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_3). When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.  
  
**Ability Modifier**: The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the [finesse](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Weapons?expansion=34047#toc_4) or thrown property break this rule. Some [spells](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#content) also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a [spell attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#toc_33) depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.  
  
**Proficiency Bonus**: You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.  
  

#### Rolling 1 or 20

Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.  
  
If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a [critical hit](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_49).  
  
If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any [modifiers](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_33) or the target’s AC.  
  

### Unseen Attackers and Targets

Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by [hiding](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_22), casting the [invisibility](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Invisibility?expansion=34047#content) spell, or lurking in darkness.  
  
When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have [disadvantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_2) on the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target’s location correctly.  
  
When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.  
  

### Ranged Attacks

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a [crossbow](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Light%20Crossbow?expansion=34047#content), hurl a [handaxe](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Handaxe?expansion=34047#content), or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many [spells](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#toc_2) also involve making a ranged attack.  
  

#### Range

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.  
If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.  
  
Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a [longbow](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Longbow?expansion=34047#content) or a [shortbow](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Shortbow?expansion=34047#content), have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has [disadvantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_2) when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range.  
  

#### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a [spell](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#toc_2), or some other means, you have [disadvantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_2) on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t [incapacitated](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=34047#toc_6).  
  

### Melee Attacks

Used in hand--to--hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a [warhammer](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Warhammer?expansion=34047#content), or an [axe](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Battleaxe?expansion=34047#content). A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few [spells](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#content) also involve making a melee attack.  
  
Most creatures have a 5-foot **reach** and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.  
  
Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an **unarmed strike**: a punch, kick, head--butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals [bludgeoning damage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_50) equal to 1 + your modifier. You are [proficient](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Character%20Advancement#toc_8) with your unarmed strikes.

  

#### Opportunity Attacks

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.  
You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see [moves](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_9) out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your [reaction](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_8) to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.  
  
You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the [Disengage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_24) action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.  
  

#### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you take the Attack action and attack with a [light](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Weapons?expansion=34047#toc_6) melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a [bonus action](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_6) to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your [ability modifier](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_1) to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that [modifier](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_33) is negative.  
  
If either weapon has the [thrown](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Weapons?expansion=34047#toc_11) property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.  
  

#### Grappling

When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.  
  
The target of your grapple must be no more than one [size](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_18) larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a [Strength (Athletics) check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_13) contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or [Dexterity (Acrobatics) check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_18) (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the [grappled](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=34047#toc_5) condition (see [Conditions](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=34047#content) ). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).  
  
**Escaping a Grapple**: A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a [Strength (Athletics)](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_13) or [Dexterity (Acrobatics) check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_18) contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.  
  
**Moving a Grappled Creature**: When you [move](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_9), you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more [sizes](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_18) smaller than you.  
  

### Contests in Combat

Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.  
  

#### Shoving a Creature

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it [prone](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=34047#toc_11) or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.  
The target must be no more than one [size](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_18) larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a [Strength (Athletics) check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_13) contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or [Dexterity (Acrobatics) check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_18) (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.  
  

## Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.  
There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three--quarters cover, the target has three--quarters cover.  
  
A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.  
  
A target with **three--quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three--quarters cover if about three--quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.  
  
A target with **total cover** can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a [spell](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#toc_2), although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
